when you change the host setting, it should restart
after finish setup, count down then refresh the page, saying default password is 0000

## hardware check
check if pico can restart
check if 192.168.1.1 also works (community fibre)
clone pico to sd
list recent requests
add whether requests were cached
change TTL to 300 or auto
POST check - check dependencies etc.

## low priority
disable inactivity timer when the progress modal is showing
the pageContent params are a mess
disables upnp (if port not blockable)
